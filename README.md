# sparphantor
SPARSA + PhantomJS + Tor. Sparsa challenge for February 2016. 

# Challenge
* Attempt to guess all of pastes on Ghost Bin: https://ghostbin.com/
* Do it an intersting way
* Open source the code

# Details
This is an attempt at being the most useless, annoying, and unthorough way of doing this for the following reasons:
* It will capture screen shots of a text-based paste website instead of doing something useful with the /raw urls
* It uses Tor to make it relatively difficult to stop my host from being directly detected
* The string guessing is random, does not de-duplicate, and will never* completely finish
